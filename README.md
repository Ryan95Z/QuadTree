# QuadTree
Implementation of a quad tree with C++ &amp; SFML.

## Building the project for Windows
1. Clone the project: `git clone https://github.com/Ryan95Z/QuadTree.git .`
1. Download and save SFML: https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php - *(Visual C++ 12 (2013) - 64-bit was the one I used)*
2. Copy the `lib` folder from SFML into `/QuadTree`.
3. Create a folder called `dlls` in `/QuadTree`.
4. Copy the dlls from SFML into this folder.
5. Open the project and compile to validate it works.
